        More future!  Make Python 2/3 compatibility a little bit easier
        
        ### Problem 
        
        `future` or `six` are hard to use: It is easy to google how to import an object in Python2, or Python3, but finding the full path in these compatibility libraries is difficult. 
        
        ## Solution
        
        All the modules and types required for compatibility are put into the `mo-future` top-level module so they are  easy to find.
        
        
        ### Flat namespace
        
        Instead of 
        
        ```python
            from future.utils import text
        ```
        
        you get the same, but without having to discover what sub-module the `text` is hiding:  
        
        ```python
            from mo_future import text
        ```
        
        
        ### Simpler imports
        
        Instead of writing conditional imports like 
        
        ```python
            try:
                from io import StringIO
            except:
                from StringIO import StringIO
        ```
        
        or 
        
        ```python
            if PY3:
                from io import StringIO
            else:
                from StringIO import StringIO
        ```
        
        you can use `mo-future`:
        
        ```python
            from mo_future import StringIO
        ```
